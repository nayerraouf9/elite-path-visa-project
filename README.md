# Elite Path — Frontend Scaffold

This repository contains a minimal Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS scaffold for the Elite Path homepage UI.

Getting started (Windows, PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies (recommended: pnpm). If you don't have `pnpm`, you can use `npm`.

```powershell
# with pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# or with npm
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Notes:
- Add a real hero image at `public/hero.jpg` (placeholder included).
- Tailwind config is in `tailwind.config.js`. Global styles are in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- Components are in `src/components` and the app router pages/live files are in `src/app`.
